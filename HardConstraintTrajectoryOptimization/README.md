# Hard-Constraint-Trajectory-Optimization-MATLAB

　　This is an implementation of corridor-constrained piecewise Bezier curve trajectory generation in MATLAB. The blue bounding boxes are corridors, and the whole trajectory is completely restricted in the corridor, the marked points are the control points of bezier curve. 

　　**You can directly run "CorridorBasedMinimumSnap.m" and see the result.**
